Hello, I'm Lumunix

I'm a professional software engineer that specializes in enterprise software architecture and process automation.


When i'm not working on developing new devops tooling or conquering an ever growing backlog of improvements, features and the occasional defect.
I like to watch horror and science fiction films. Play World of Warcraft
 and stream on Twitch and do LGBTQ outreach/charity events.



Oh, I guess I should also address the elephant in the room, I'm also a furry.
