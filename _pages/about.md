Hello, I'm Lumunix

I'm a professional software engineer that specializes in enterprise software architecture and process automation.
I graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 2015 with an undergrad in Computer Science, I also graduated with a masters in Software Engineering in 2019.
I like to watch horror and science fiction films, play World of Warcraft and stream on Twitch. I am always excited to talk about new computer technology and cars.
Oh, I guess I should also address the elephant in the room, I'm also a furry.

## About the site

Lets start with the technical, this site is built using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Handling the dynamic site functionality is the popular [Staticman](https://staticman.net/).

You might be wondering why I chose to make this site such an odd color? Why I'm using pictures of a drawn characterization of a fennec with circuit trace markings to talk about technical topics? Well truth be told I was tired of so many blogs and professional sites being too "Suit and tie". I want to be fun, approachable and engaging. I love to adventure and discover and share my experiences. Why shouldn't I try something different, I want to be unapologetically me.
