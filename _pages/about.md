Hello, I'm Lumunix

I'm a professional software engineer that specializes in enterprise software architecture and process automation.


When I'm not working on developing new devops tooling or conquering an ever growing backlog of improvements, features and the occasional defect.
I like to watch horror and science fiction films. Play World of Warcraft
 and stream on Twitch and do LGBTQ outreach/charity events.



Oh, I guess I should also address the elephant in the room, I'm also a furry.

## About the site

Lets start with the technical, this site is built using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Handling the dynamic site functionality is the popular [Staticman](https://staticman.net/).

You might be wondering why I chose to make this site such an odd color? Why I'm using pictures of a drawn characterization of a fennec with circuit trace markings? Well truth be told I was tired of so many blogs and professional sites being too "Suit and tie". I like to develop things, and I find it fun so why not have a site where I show a piece of me and showcase my hobbies and a little about myself.
